# XPRIZE Rainforest

XPRIZE Rainforest is a global five-year, $10 million competition that challenges teams to innovate rapid and autonomous technology to expedite the monitoring of biodiversity and data collection, enhancing our understanding of tropical rainforest ecosystems around the world. 

## My experience

Throughout 1.5 years with the competition, I helped create an AI system to identify bird species by songs, design the latch mechanism attachment for the drone, and make a drone controller range extender. 

I was lucky to be one of six students (out of ~250) selected for the traveling team in the Semi-finals in Singapore and one of four selected to compete in the Amazon Rainforest for the Finals. During the competition, I helped with field work and data analytics. Our team made it and recently competed in the [Finals in Brazil](https://www.iit.edu/news/team-led-illinois-tech-professor-returns-amazon-after-competing-xprize-rainforest-finals).

After the competition, I am working independently to triangulate animal sounds in real-time.
