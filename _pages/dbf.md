# AIAA Design/Build/Fly

Design-Build-Flight (DBF) is an annual international competition with about 100 participants, hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The competition tests students' abilities to design, fabricate, and demonstrate the flight capabilities of an unmanned, electric-powered, radio-controlled aircraft that can best meet the specified mission profile.

## 2023

This was the first year Illinois Tech competed in the competition. I was a member, responsible for laser cutting, 3D printing, and designing the motor test stand. The airplane featured detachable wings, asymmetric center of gravity, and ease of assemble within 5 mins. 

## 2024

Keeping the momentum from the previous year, we gathered a team of 10 students, and I was the propulsion team lead. The theme of this year was paramedic planes. 

My main responsibility was to select the battery, motor, and propeller combination and set up the radio control system. In addition, I hosted training hosting training sessions for new members, wrote the technical report, and helped manufacturing during the final stages.

*Fun fact: our entire plane could be built from scratch in half a day!*

## 2025

I was trusted by my friends to lead the project for 2025, and we are working hard on the upcoming design proposal. The main challenge for this year is remotely deploying a 0.5 lb autonomous glider.

# Some moments

These are some picture from the competition in 2024. Unfortunately, I lost access to the drive of most 2023 pictures.
